# VideoGenerator

VideoGenerator is a project that combines different services and scripts to generate videos with added audio and subtitles. It uses technologies such as Docker to isolate and run different parts of the application.

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer: Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently in its early stages of development and is not fully functional yet. It serves as a learning and experimentation ground, and as such, it may contain incomplete features, bugs, and non-operational components.

## Technologies
- Python: Used for scripting and coordinating the different parts of the application.
- Docker: Used to containerize and run the different services.
- ElevenLabs: A service used to generate audio from text.

## Purpose and Example

This project is inspired by the desire to automate the creation of content that resembles the content in the following [example video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2kRrulJsPc). The goal is to automate the entire process from generating scripts, creating audio, adding subtitles, and cutting videos into smaller segments. With a future expansion plan, we also plan to add the ability to automatically upload processed videos to YouTube.

### Workflow

1. **Script-generator**: Starts automatically and generates scripts by interacting with ChatGPT.
2. **Elevenlabs-service**: Starts when script-generation is complete and generates audio for the given script.
3. **Auto-subtitle**: Starts when audio generation is complete and adds subtitles to the video.
4. **Downloaded-videos**: Done. Starts manually and takes a link to a video as input. It cuts a longer video into shorter segments. This service can also take a list of videos as input.
5. **Device-cloning**: Done. Starts manually and clones a device.

### Planned Improvements

- Automatic upload of processed videos to YouTube.
